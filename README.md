# MIT-6.005-2016-PS3
My solution to MIT OCW 6.005 PS3

Problem set description and requirements can be found in https://ocw.mit.edu/ans7870/6/6.005/s16/psets/ps3/

Decided to additionally implement a Minus operation in order to handle negative expressions, altough this was no mandatory implementation.
Power expression is used only for simplification by bundling together multiplications of same variables. The implementation required not to produce an output with a new feature unless that feature appeared in its input.
